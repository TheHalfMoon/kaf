> orcel is a filesystem-first, Apache-2.0 framework for building durable backend AI agents that run on Vercel or self-hosted infrastructure. orcel is currently in beta.

Use this file to choose the smallest relevant documentation set. Use \`/sitemap.md\` for the exhaustive page map and \`/llms-full.txt\` only for offline indexing or a large context window. For an installed project, prefer \`node_modules/@orcel/orcel/docs/\`: those docs match the installed orcel version, while orcel.dev documents the latest release.

orcel.dev publishes framework documentation. It is not a shared API, authorization server, MCP server, or A2A server. Every deployed orcel app exposes its own \`/orcel/v1\` routes and authentication policy. External API, OpenAPI, and MCP URLs in these docs describe third-party connections or examples unless stated otherwise.

Documentation links below point directly to Markdown. Remove the \`.md\` suffix for the canonical HTML page.

## Introduction

- [Getting Started](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/getting-started.md): Create a project, configure model credentials, and run your first agent.

## Core Concepts

- [Execution Model and Durability](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/concepts/execution-model-and-durability.md): Understand sessions, checkpointed steps, and parked work.
- [Sessions, Runs, and Streaming](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/concepts/sessions-runs-and-streaming.md): Understand session IDs, NDJSON events, controls, and reconnecting.
- [Default Harness](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/concepts/default-harness.md): Understand model context and compaction in the built-in loop.
- [Built-in Tools](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/concepts/built-in-tools.md): Review default tools and add opt-in tools such as Workflow, glob, grep, and sleep.

- [Instructions](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/instructions.md): Write the agent's always-on system prompt.
- [Tools](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/tools.md): Define typed actions and gate sensitive calls on human approval.
- [Memory](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/memory.md): Give an agent cross-session context through orcel-managed slots backed by Supermemory, the built-in file provider, or your own provider.
- [File Memory](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/memory/file.md): Configure the built-in bounded document provider and its storage backends.
- [Build a Memory Provider](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/memory/custom-provider.md): Implement the recall, capture, and tools contract for any store or memory service.
- [Connections](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/connections.md): Connect external MCP and OpenAPI servers without exposing credentials to the model.
- [Channels](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/channels/overview.md): Expose the agent through HTTP, Slack, Discord, and other messaging surfaces.
- [Base orcel Channel](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/channels/orcel.md): Understand the HTTP API exposed by each running orcel app.
- [Skills](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/skills.md): Add procedures that the model loads on demand.
- [Sandbox](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/sandbox.md): Configure the isolated shell, filesystem, lifecycle, and network policy.
- [Subagents](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/subagents.md): Delegate work to copies of the root agent or declared specialists.
- [Evals](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/evals/overview.md): Define repeatable scored checks and run them with \`orcel eval\`.
- [Durable State](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/concepts/state.md): Persist per-session memory across step boundaries.
- [Session Context](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/guides/session-context.md): Use session metadata and runtime accessors in authored code.
- [Schedules](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/schedules.md): Run prompts or handlers on a cron cadence.
- [Hooks](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/guides/hooks.md): Subscribe to runtime stream events.
- [Dynamic Capabilities](${ORCEL_ORIGIN}/docs/guides/dynamic-capabilities.md): Resolve models, tools, skills, subagents, and instructions at runtime.

## Integrate
