 * Resolves the absolute path to the installed orcel binary from the app's

 *
 * Uses module resolution rather than assuming an app-local `node_modules/@orcel/orcel`:
 * npm workspaces hoist orcel to the workspace root, so the app-local path does
 * not exist there, while pnpm symlinks it app-locally. orcel does not export
 * `./bin/orcel.js`, but it does export `./package.json`, so we resolve that and
 * derive the bin path from the package root. Falls back to the conventional
 * app-local path when orcel cannot be resolved (e.g. before install).
